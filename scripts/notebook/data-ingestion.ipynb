At some time towards the end of the seventeenth\\ncentury, his forefathers had migrated from their native lands to Govindpur, one of the three villages\\nwhich later came to constitute Calcutta. In the course of time, the family came to acquire property\\nand considerable business interests through the pursuit of commercial and banking activities. They\\nhad particularly benefited from the growing power of the British East India Company.\\nRabindranath’s grandfather, Dwarkanath Tagore, lived lavishly and broke the Hindu religious ban\\nof those times by travelling to Europe, just like his contemporary, Rammohan Roy, the nineteenth\\ncentury social and religious reformer.\\nRoy started a religious reform movement in 1828 that came to be known as the Brahma\\nSamaj Movement. Rabindranath’s grandfather supported Roy in his attempts at reforming Hindu\\nsociety. Dwarkanath’s son, Devendranath Tagore, also became a staunch supporter of the Brahma\\nSamaj Movement. In order to encourage its spread, in 1863 he established a meditation centre and\\nguest house on some land about 100 miles from Calcutta at a place called ‘Santiniketan’, the Abode\\nof Peace.\\nAlthough deeply steeped in Hindu and Islamic traditions, Tagore’s family contributed large\\nsums of money for the introduction of Western education, including colleges for the study of\\nscience and medicine. This peculiar situation explains the combination of tradition and experiment\\nthat came to characterize Rabindranath Tagore’s attitude to life.\\nRabindranath’s father was one of the leading figures of the newly awakened phase of\\nBengali society. He had been educated at one stage in Rammohan Roy’s Anglo-Hindu school and\\nhad been greatly influenced by Roy’s character, ideals and religious devotion. Devendranath Tagore\\nwas well versed in European philosophy and, though deeply religious, did not accept all aspects of\\nHinduism. He was to have a profound influence on his son’s mental and practical attitudes.\\nRabindranath was the fourteenth child of his parents. His brothers and sisters were poets,\\nmusicians, playwrights and novelists and the Tagore home was thus filled with musical, literary and\\ndramatic pursuits. The family was also involved with diverse activities at the national level.\\nImportant changes were taking place in Bengal at the time Rabindranath was born. Iswar\\nChandra Vidyasagar had been attempting to reform the position of women in society. Schools\\nusing English as the language of teaching were being established, alongside the traditional Sanskrit\\nschools. Vidyasagar had established Bengali-medium schools at different places in Bengal with little\\nor limited government support. He had also established a centre to train teachers for these schools.\\nRabindranath attended this school and, as he says himself, owed his love of Bengali language and\\nliterature to it. He was also sent to a number of English-speaking schools, but he did not like their'),\n",

The\\nremainder of his education was carried out at home through his own personal efforts and with the\\nhelp of tutors in various subjects. He also had lessons from professionals in wrestling, music and\\ndrawing. The manner of his early schooling was to leave a deep impression on him. 2\\nWhen Rabindranath w as 12, his father took him to Santiniketan, the meditation centre\\nestablished in 1863. During their brief stay there, Devendranath gave his son lessons in Sanskrit,\\nastronomy and the scriptures that formed the basis of his reformed religion. After these lessons\\nwere over, Rabindranath was free to roam among the fields and forests. This routine continued\\nwhen father and son journeyed on and stayed at Dalhousie in the Himalayan foothills. After lessons\\nin Sanskrit, English literature and religion, the would-be poet explored the mountains and forests.\\nLife in close proximity to nature was unknown to him in the urban surroundings of Calcutta.\\nThe close and affectionate contact between teacher and pupil that he felt when his father\\ntaught him was also completely absent in Calcutta. It was this childhood experience of the willing\\npupil enthusiastically following lessons given by his father in the manner of a noble teacher among\\nagreeable surroundings that guided Rabindranath in establishing a school at Santiniketan in 1901.\\nIn 1878, when he was 17, he was sent to London by his father to qualify for the Indian Civil\\nService or as a lawyer. He took his matriculation examination and then joined University College,\\nLondon. He came to like his lessons in English literature, and became exposed to British social life\\nand Western music, both of which he enjoyed. But he returned home suddenly after some eighteen\\nmonths without completing his education. However, he did gain the impression that human nature\\nwas perhaps the same everywhere.\\nBack in India he continued with his personal education and his creative writing and music.\\nHis Sandhya Sangeet [Evening songs], a volume of Bengali verse, came out in 1882. It was at\\nabout this time that he had a kind of mystical experience that led him to appreciate the unity of all\\nthat exists and himself as an integral part of it. In the same year, he wrote his famous poem\\nNirjharer Swapna Bhanga [The awakening of the fountain]. He became aware of his unusual talent\\nas a poet. Between 1884 and 1890 various volumes of his poems appeared, together with a profuse\\noutput of prose articles, criticism, plays and novels.\\nTagore married when he was 23. At this stage, beyond his literary pursuits, he had begun\\nsharing his father’s religious responsibilities. In 1890 he made a second trip to the United Kingdom,\\nbut came back after a month to look after the family estates.\\nThis responsibility opened up new vistas of inspiration for him. Whereas his previous\\nliterary work had been primarily based on imagination, he now came to acquire a direct and\\nintimate experience of the wretched life led by the poor Bengali peasants. This new experience led\\nto the composition of Galpaguccha [A bunch of stories] (1900), and the many letters he wrote to\\nhis niece, subsequently published as Chhinnapatra [Torn letters] and Chhinnapatravali [A\\ncollection of torn letters], considered to be landmarks in the writing of Bengali prose and in\\ndescribing the countryside of Bengal.\\nTagore was overwhelmed by the economic, socia l and political misery in which the\\npeasants lived. He gave a description of them at a later date:\\nOur so-called responsible classes live in comfort because the common man has not yet understood his situation. That\\nis why the landlord beats him. The money-lender holds him in his clutches; the foreman abuses him; the policeman\\nfleeces him; the priest exploits him; and the magistrate picks his pocket. 3\\nThese conditions, he thought, cannot be changed by appealing to the religious sentiments of the\\nlandlord, policeman or money-lender. In human society, necessity is a greater force than charity.\\nThe first requirement therefore is that people should discover the bond that holds them together as'),\n",

If there is one path likely to achieve this, it is education. Tagore realized from his own\\nexperience of the farmers’ attitudes and their social behaviour that strength can be generated only in\\na self-reliant village society developing its own locus of power and its own momentum of growth.\\nHe turned again and again in various contexts to this theme of local self-reliance, local initiatives,\\nlocal leadership and local self-government centring on co-operative ways of life. This could be  the\\nbasis for reorganizing India’s fragmented rural society, and could serve as an instrument of welfare.\\nTagore realized that education and village councils or panchayats were the only available\\ninstruments of economic and social change, and that the villagers should obtain various forms of\\nexpert help from outside to accomplish this change. As he says: ‘Poverty springs from disunity and\\nwealth from co-operation. From all points of view this is the fundamental truth of human\\ncivilization.’ 4\\nAs a young landlord managing his family’s rural estates, Tagore came to realize the\\npossibilities of introducing education and co-operation to transform rural life. Thus he began to turn\\nhis thoughts towards the problems of education. He spoke publicly on ‘The Vicissitudes of\\nEducation’ 5\\n in which he made a strong plea for the use of the mother-tongue. His first experiments\\nin teaching also date from this period. He started his own school in Seliadah, the headquarters of his\\nestate, to which he sent his own children to be taught by teachers in various subjects, including an\\nEnglishman to teach them the English language. He also started organizing co-operatives, schools\\nand hospitals in the villages of his estates and tried to introduce improved farming methods. All\\nthese efforts for rural reconstruction went on while he pursued his creative writing. Tagore called\\nthis the period of his Sadhana—preparation, reflection, austerity and self-education for an active\\nsocial life. He lived either at Seliadah or on his houseboat on the river Padma, visiting villages,\\ntalking to people and listening to their problems. Tagore’s later educational experiments arose from\\nthis experience.\\nIn 1901 he left Seliadah where he had undertaken these experiments and moved to\\nSantiniketan where, with his father’s consent, he started a boarding school. The\\nBrahamacharyashram (or Ashram) School was inaugurated on 22 December 1901 with only a few\\npupils, his son being one of them, and with an equal number of teachers. It was to be run on the\\npattern of teachers and pupils living together amidst natural surroundings and willingly accepting an\\naustere standard of living, often working with their own hands. Of the five teachers, three were\\nChristians—two of whom were Catholics and the third was his son’s English teacher from\\nSeliadah. The orthodox Hindus were offended by this situation and he did not get any assistance\\nfrom them. No fees were accepted from students, all expenses being borne by Tagore himself. In\\nthe course of time, this Ashram School expanded as the poet’s reputation grew.\\nLife at Santiniketan left its impression on  the poet’s literary work. He wrote about India’s\\npast and present, and stories of noble self-sacrifice. He published more realistic novels such as\\nChoker Bali [Eyesore] (1901), Naukadubi [The wreck] (1903) and Gora (1910). He was trying to\\ndiscover the eternal India that succeeds in achieving unity amidst a bewildering diversity of races,\\ncultures and religions.\\nIn 1912 Tagore left for the United Kingdom once again. Some of his poems and writings\\nhad already been translated into English and had attracted the attention of the well-known English\\npainter Sir William Rothenstein and the poet W. B. Yeats. He made such an impression on the\\nBritish writers and intellectuals that he was at once accepted as a great poet and intellectual. He\\nwas awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in November 1913 and came back to India after visiting\\nthe United States of America, delivering there his ‘Sadhana’ lectures (The Realization of Life,\\n1913). In 1916 Tagore went abroad again to Japan and then to the United States of America\\ndelivering lectures, published later in two volumes as Nationalism (1917 b) and Personality\\n(1917 c).\\nThis international experience gave him a new idea, that he must bring his country into'),\n",

He felt that overemphasis on narrow nationalism led men and\\ncountries into paths of conflict. There should be an institution that emphasized the unity of the\\nworld’s cultures and streams of knowledge. He considered Santiniketan to be that institution. He\\nwas thus already contemplating the foundation of Visva Bharati, an international centre of culture\\nand humanistic studies.\\nThe foundation stone of Visva Bharati was laid on 24 December 1918. A separate\\ninstitution called Sri Niketan was established in 1921. 6\\nEducation in India: historical background\\nBy 1857, four years before Rabindranath was born, British power in India had been consolidated\\nand the general foundation of a colonial system of education had been laid. The stated aim of\\nBritish policy was the promotion of English studies with English language as the medium of\\ninstruction and the creation of a class of Indians who had been brought up in an English way. As a\\nresult, the traditional system of village, Sanskrit and Islamic schools languished. 7\\nNational universities had been  established at Bombay, Madras and Calcutta, but secondary\\nschools and universities were still the reserve of a small elite. The gulf between the fortunate upper\\nclasses and the vast masses of rural poor continued to widen. On the other hand, great socio-\\neconomic changes were taking place in the country, and especially in Calcutta and in other towns as\\nthey grew in size. Railways were built; factories sprang up; municipal water supplies arrived. A new\\nclass of people came to adopt European dress, manners, attitudes and life styles. Old values and\\ntraditions came to be questioned. It was a period of social upheaval and reforms in India.\\nTowards the end of the nineteenth and in the early twentieth centuries the middle class,\\nwhich had come into being following the establishment of universities in 1857, began to protest\\nagainst the imposed system of education and its parallel language policy. It is true that in the middle\\nof the nineteenth century, when the British system was being introduced, a powerful group of urban\\nclasses expressed their preference for such studies. But, seeing the consequences and with a\\ngrowing awareness of the Indian cultural heritage and history, the middle classes had come to\\nresent the education which was being offered. While Tagore preferred the traditional system to the\\nnew one, he did not want to bring it back without considerable changes.\\nThis period also saw a rise in Indian nationalism. There was resentment against an imitation\\nof British lifestyles and against British rule, coupled with increased awareness and appreciation of\\nIndia’s cultural traditions. Tagore’s educational and other writings of the period reflect this\\nnationalist trend. His concern with educational reform grew in intensity after 1901, and more so\\nafter 1905. Dissatisfaction with the existing system of education led to a general concern with\\nreform.\\nA tragic series of family bereavements probably caused Tagore’s withdrawal from the\\ngrowing national struggle for independence in the country. He retired to his Ashram School to\\nconcentrate on its development and on the task of village reconstruction that he had initiated at\\nSeliadah.\\nTagore on education\\nThe difficulty in writing about Tagore’s educational ideas lies in the fact that he did not set them\\ndown in a connected account. His views are found scattered in a large number of independent\\nessays and journal articles, in speeches to various audiences and in letters to individuals over a\\nnumber of years. 8\\n Addresses to foreign audiences about his school at Santiniketan and on Visva'),\n",

Only recently have attempts been made to collect and publish\\nthese pieces in their original Bengali. There has been a tendency to group these diffuse writings into\\nthree broad divisions.\\nTHE FIRST PHASE: 1892–1901\\nTagore considered lack of education to be the main obstacle in the way of India’s progress and at\\nthe root of all its problems. The prevailing, colonial education system he found unsatisfactory since\\nthe only objective it appeared to serve was to produce clerks to man government offices and British\\nbusinesses in India. The basic objectives of any worthwhile national education system, such as\\npromoting creativity, freedom, joy and an awareness of a country’s cultural heritage, were\\ncompletely ignored.\\nThe education offered was not even modern, since it was unrelated to any developments\\ngoing on the field of education outside India. Irrespective of the content, the medium of education\\nwas English—a foreign language—so that learning this language was an additional burden for\\nyoung Indian students. Particularly, the educational process failed to develop scientific attitudes and\\nthe spirit of inquiry. On the other hand, it divided the Indian people into two classes: those who\\nreceived this education and those who did not. The second group, comprising nearly everyone\\nliving in the countryside, remained almost completely cut off from the affluent, educated, English-\\nspeaking class living in cities and towns.\\nIn the pre-colonial system, a common langu age promoted an unobstructed flow of culture,\\neven if formal education was not available to all. However, there was no place even in informal\\neducational activities for modern subjects, like history, science and geography, and it did not\\npromote objectivity in thinking, nor facilitate desirable social change.\\nTHE SECOND PHASE, 1901–18\\nTagore’s preoccupation during this second phase was with developing an appropriate system of\\nnational education for India. Each nation was different and this fact should be reflected, he thought,\\nin its system of education. The Ashram School at Santiniketan was founded in 1901 on the basis of\\nthe ancient Indian forest schools.\\nIn Tapovan [The Forest Schools of India] (1909) Tagore asserted that the forest school\\nwas typical of the Indian system of education with its emphasis on three basic elements of Indian\\nculture, namely Advaita (non-duality) in the field of knowledge, friendship for all in the field of\\nfeeling, and fulfilment of one’s duties without concern for the outcomes in the field of action. In his\\nview, the forest school integrated education with Sadhana (disciplining one’s senses and one’s own\\nlife). But Tagore updated this form of school to include science and similar modern subjects.\\nThe second significant essay  of this period was Shikshar Vahana [The Vehicle of\\nEducation] (1915) emphasizing the importance of the mother-tongue as the medium of education.\\nThe use of English in education hindered assimilation of what was taught, and kept education\\nconfined to urban centres and the upper classes. Thus, if the vast rural masses were to benefit, it\\nwas absolutely essential to switch over to the use of Bengali in the context of Bengal at all levels of\\neducation, including higher education. The ideal school, according to Tagore, should be established\\naway from the turmoil of human habitation under an open sky and surrounded by vistas of fields,\\ntrees and plants. Living in a forest was also associated with austere pursuits and renunciation. The\\nvast background of nature represented a grand perspective against which all objects, all feelings\\nassumed their due proportions. He also referred to the significance of educating feelings as distinct\\nfrom educating the senses and the intellect. The word ‘forest’ used in this context, he explained,\\nwas not dense jungle, but Tapovana, the forest clearing. 9'),\n",

Those truths are not commercialism, imperialism or nationalism, but rather\\nuniversalism. The aim was all-round development of the individual personality through harmonious\\ninteraction and union of the spirit with the environment.\\nAbout the place of religion in education, Rabindranath said: ‘Nature and human spirit,\\nwedded together, would constitute our temple and selfless good deeds our worship’ ( Dharma\\nSikhsha, 1912).\\nTagore himself was a teacher at the Ashram School and also gave thought to educational\\nmethods. He taught English language, and in the evenings related stories from Indian history to the\\nchildren. He wrote plays for the students to perform and entertaining verse for children, as well as\\nsimple textbooks in various subjects. 10\\nTagore was against any conspicuous emphasis on materials, buildings, furniture or book s\\nthat imitated Western educational institutions in India. He thought that this would make education\\ntoo expensive for the common people. He was against bookish learning:\\nBooks have come between our mind and life. They deprive us of our natural faculty of getting knowledge directly from nature and\\nlife and have generated within us the habit of knowing everything through books. We touch the world not with our mind, but with\\nour books. They dehumanize and make us unsocial…. Let the students gather knowledge and materials from different regions of\\nthe country, from direct sources and from their own independent efforts. 11\\nTHE THIRD PHASE (1918–41)\\nVisva Bharati, Tagore’s conception of a world university, was founded at the end of the First\\nWorld War with a determination to go beyond aggressive nationalism and to build friendship with\\nall nations.\\nAfter 1913, his travels abroad made him increasingly aware of what was going on in other\\ncountries. He came also to know a large number of intellectuals in the countries he visited. This in\\nturn led him to emphasize co-operation between East and West, North and South (in today’s\\njargon), in the field of humanistic studies and culture. From children’s education and rural\\ndevelopment, he increasingly shifted his attention to university education and developing the\\nsurrounding villages as one of the university’s functions during this third phase. He wanted to\\ndevise an alternative form of education.\\nIn every nation, education is intimately associated with the life of the people. For us, modern education is relevant\\nonly to turning out clerks, lawyers, doctors, magistrates and policemen…. This education has not reached the farmer,\\nthe oil grinder, nor the potter. No other educated society has been struck with such disaster…. If ever a truly Indian\\nuniversity is established it must from the very beginning implement India’s own knowledge of economics, agriculture,\\nhealth, medicine and of all other everyday science from the surrounding villages. Then alone can the school or\\nuniversity become the centre of the country’s way of living . This school must practise agriculture, dairying and\\nweaving using the best modern methods…. I have proposed to call this school Visva Bharati. 12\\nTagore was convinced that no form of education offered in India, be it at school or at university\\nlevel, would be complete without knowledge of patterns of rural living and without an effort by the\\nuniversities to rejuvenate rural life. He considered this to be an important aspect of Visva Bharati’s\\ntotal activity. 13\\nWriting about them in 1919 in his paper Ashantosher Karon [Cause of Dissatisfaction], he\\nexpressed his deep anguish at the contemporary attempts in India to establish new universities in\\nexactly the same mould as existing ones due to a lack of will or a lack of courage to attempt new\\nforms. This had become imperative in view of the fact that the civil service was saturated and, as\\nthe student members grew, the majority of graduates failed to get clerical or any other type of\\nwhite-collar jobs and were good for nothing else. The time had thus come, Tagore urged, to'),\n",

In the addresses he gave and the essays he\\nwrote from 1919 to 1936 he tried to answer this question. In his own words:\\nWe must try to understand how Indian genius expressed itself [...] Unless we try to put these together and discover the\\nintegrating factors behind these diverse streams of thought and make them a subject of study at our universities, we\\nwould only be borrowing knowledge from abroad. The natural habitat for knowledge is where it is produced. The\\nmain task of universities is to produce knowledge , its dissemination is its secondary function. We must invite those\\nintellectuals and scholars to our universities who are engaged in research, invention or creative activity. 14\\nWhile nations sought primarily to give their citizens a means of livelihood through education,\\nTagore believed that there was a more important aim—that of personal fulfilment and self-\\nimprovement. It was important to borrow knowledge and experience from abroad, but not to use\\nthem as the foundation for Indian education.\\nEven so, if there was one European quality which Indian university students must acquire  it\\nwas ‘the desire to know, to find out about the laws of nature and to use them for the betterment of\\nthe conditions of human beings’ .15\\n Science and its applications in the form of technology have led\\nto the power and prosperity of Western countries. Unless India acquired knowledge of science and\\ntechnology through its universities and schools, poverty and powerlessness would continue. To\\ntransform life and make it richer, healthier and more educated, it was imperative to resort to\\ntechnology and science. But Tagore wanted science to be taught along with India’s own\\nphilosophical and spiritual knowledge at Indian universities. 16\\nHowever, science without the constraint of self-knowledge, without appreciating that the\\nquest for knowledge is the most important aim of human existence, leads to an endless desire for\\nmaterial goods and well-being, and the meaningless pursuit of the instruments of war and power,\\nwhich are often the origin of conflict between nations and end, ultimately, in the suppression of the\\nweaker by the stronger. That is why both spiritual and scientific knowledge are considered by\\nTagore as equally important.\\nIn an address on the functions of the university ,17\\n Tagore argued that a university is an\\nattempt by a nation to aggregate knowledge at one place, to develop it and to disseminate it to the\\nyounger generation.\\nLong before universities in the West had been established, there existed in India universities,\\nsuch as Nalanda and Vikramshila, where various branches of knowledge had been pursued by\\nscholars for centuries during the Buddhist period of India’s history. Students came to these\\nuniversities from far and near in Asia to learn about the subjects taught, and to live with the\\nteachers who were respected for their exemplary way of life. When universities came to be founded\\nin Europe, the hold of religion was loosened. New methods of acquiring knowledge led to rapid\\ngrowth in the fields of social, physical and life sciences. Modern universities collect existing\\nknowledge in various fields from within a country or abroad, preserve and develop it and make it\\navailable to the younger generations. But contemporary Indian universities had not been concerned\\nabout collecting and preserving the national heritage, and enriching it by fusing it with knowledge\\ncoming from abroad.

The working of the\\ngovernment, its courts of law and its education system were conducted in a language completely\\nunintelligible to the majority of Indians. He contrasted the situation in India with what he had seen\\nin the USSR and in Japan, where the governments had been able to educate their people within a\\nvery short time. Educating India’s entire population and restoring the flow of culture from the\\neducated classes to the rural population would not come about unless the mother-tongue was\\nadopted as the medium of teaching.\\nThe second experiment: Sri Niketan\\nSantiniketan developed continuously from 1901 to 1921. The school, called Patha Bhawan,\\neventually became affiliated to Calcutta University and students could thus take the matriculation\\nexamination. For a long time, the funding of the school was entirely assumed by Tagore. This was\\npossible because teachers’ salaries were very low. Most of Tagore’s personal income, proceeds\\nfrom the sale of his property, most of the Nobel Prize money and royalties from his books were the\\nsources of school finance. Only after receiving the Nobel Prize and after being knighted by the\\nBritish did the Indian Government begin to take an interest in him.\\nTagore was convinced that some new form of sc hooling could be worked out for the\\nvillage children in India based on life in the countryside. He had purchased an old building and some\\nland at a village called Surul, not far from Santiniketan. Fortunately for Santiniketan, Tagore met\\nLeonard Elmhirst in the United States in 1921. Elmhirst was at that time reading agricultural\\nscience at Cornell University and was keen on spending some time in India doing rural\\nreconstruction work. Tagore requested Elmhirst to join him. He told Elmhirst that Santiniketan was\\nsurrounded by a number of villages which, ‘for some reason, appeared to be in a state of steady\\ndecline’ .18\\n There was no sign of effort on the part of the villagers: there was no joy, no food, no\\nhealth, no idea of the importance of their own initiative and no co-operation among them. Tagore\\nwanted Elmhirst first to find out why and then suggest remedial action. The objective was to raise\\nthe villagers’ income, but the higher aim according to Tagore was to make them happy. 19\\nTagore was somewhat disapp ointed that Santiniketan had failed to achieve the ideal of\\nbringing scientific knowledge to bear on life in the countryside. In order to improve the human\\ncondition in the villages of Eastern India, the population had to throw off their belief in fate and\\nrealize the importance of depending upon their own efforts. This is what Tagore had in mind when\\nhe launched the rural reconstruction work at Sri Niketan in a school called Shikshasastra. The\\nobjective of the new school was to provide an all-round education for village children, enabling\\nthem to earn a decent livelihood but also equipping them to improve rural life in all its aspects. 20\\nFrom the very beginning, the major thrust of the programme at Sri Niketan under Elmhirst\\ncame to be increasing the productivity of the land. But Tagore also wanted a total improvement\\ncovering agriculture, education, health and social life in the villages. Agricultural research and\\nexperiments would be undertaken at Sri Niketan and the fruits of this research were to be carried to\\nthe villages. At the same time, medical care and the eradication of malaria were considered equally\\nimportant. At the centre, specialists in various fields worked together to overcome the difficulties of\\nrural life. In addition, a scout movement was organized to mobilize the children as a starting point\\nfor drawing their parents into the village development programme.\\nA fundamental area of instruction at Sri Niketan was handicrafts; it was compulsory for all\\nstudents to learn a trade. Another major activity was the launching of some 200 co-operative\\nsocieties for agricultural credit, irrigation, granaries, etc. Experiments were made on new crops and'),\n",

The village welfare department initiated public\\nworks (repairing and excavating reservoirs), looked after village schools, maintained a mobile\\nlibrary for villages, organized social and cultural activities and ran the scout movement. There was a\\nhealth section with a central dispensary; and a maternity and child-welfare section was added in\\n1940.\\nSri Niketa n aimed at combining work with joy. Picnics, excursions, games, music, theatrical\\nperformances and celebrating socio-religious festivals constituted regular features of the calendar.\\nNew Year’s Day, the Rainy Season festival, the New Rice festival, the Spring festival were—and\\nstill are—all regular features. Tagore added Halkarshan (ploughing the land festival) and Van\\nMahotosava (tree planting). Apart from adding joy to dreary village life, some of these festivals\\nbrought students and villagers to work together.\\nFor years Tagore tried to convince his countrymen through his speeches, stories, novels,\\npoems and songs to work for rural revival. The call went unheeded until Gandhi came on the Indian\\npolitical scene. Single handed, the poet had started his work: ‘They call you mad. Wait for\\ntomorrow and keep silent’ (Poems, 1942).\\nOf course, turning out songs is my proper vocation. But those who are unfortunate cannot afford to limit their choice\\nto the works they do. They must also bear the burden of tasks they cannot do. The scale of our enterprise can never be\\na matter of pride to us, but let us hope that its truth will be. Ideas, if they have the vitality of truth in them, grow and\\nspread in the course of time. 21\\nHow correct Tagore was in this respect. The entire programme followed at Sri Niketan for rural\\ndevelopment was adopted by India’s five-year plans as the correct approach to rural community\\ndevelopment.\\nInfluences\\nApart from the three remarkable Englishmen who were Tagore’s collaborators, namely C. F.\\nAndrews, William Pearson and Leonard Elmhirst, numerous other scholars came to Santiniketan at\\nthe poet’s invitation to participate in the teaching programmes. 22\\nTagore disowned being influenced by any of the well-known educationists. It was not any\\nnew theory of education but the memory of his schooldays that led him to establish his residential\\nschools. ‘I established my institution in a beautiful spot away from the town where the children had\\nthe greatest freedom possible under the shade of ancient trees.’ 23\\nThrough contact with nature, by making them aware of community relations and with the\\nhelp of literature, festivals and religious teaching, he tried to develop the souls of his children. But\\nthis turned out to be not quite enough, so he introduced work education as ‘a joyous exercise of\\nour inventive and constructive energies that help to build up character.’ 24\\nIn many respects Tagore’s ideas relating to the education of children resemble those of\\nRousseau, Fröbel, Dewey, Montessori and others. For instance, Rousseau considered nature as\\nchildren’s teacher, as does Tagore, but unlike Rousseau he retains a significant role for the teacher.\\nFröbel and Tagore both advocate harmony with all that exists to be achieved through education;\\nthey are both in favour of play and domestic activities as part of education during infancy and\\nactivity in the community as part of the educational process during childhood. Fröbel stops here;\\nbut Tagore includes subsequent education under the purview of activity-oriented education. Both\\nare for joy and festivities, and an awareness of the child’s dignity as part of the educational\\nenvironment. The resemblances between Fröbel and Tagore’s ideas are indeed striking.

His views were linked with the\\ndevelopment of his own mind and spirit, and his profound understanding of India’s traditional\\neducational experience and philosophy.\\nHis activity-oriented school for village children appears to have inspired Gandhi’s ide as on\\nbasic education. Tagore’s influence can also be seen in the report of the Kothari Commission on\\nEducation in India.\\nIn Tagore’s view, the higher aim of education was the same as that of a person’s life, that\\nis, to achieve fulfilment and completeness. There was a lesser aim, that of providing the individual\\nwith a satisfactory means of livelihood, without which a person would not be able to satisfy his/her\\nbasic requirements and thus fail to achieve either of these two aims. Tagore also imagined that the\\nlimitless development of man is possible only in an environment free from any kind of bondage.\\nApart from the scriptures, it would seem that he was influenced by the attitudes that arose in\\nEurope during the Renaissance and the Age of Reason.\\nIn his view, education was not intellectual development alone. It should also develop a\\nstudent’s aesthetic nature and creativity. The quest for knowledge and physical activity in an\\nagreeable environment were integral parts of the process. Freedom and creativity are linked in\\nTagore’s thought, one conditioning the other. The more people go beyond the limitations of their\\nanimal nature, the closer they come to humanism, freedom and unity and are then able to develop\\ntheir creativity. This quest alone gives a meaning to life, and education is an effort to make life\\nmeaningful. Here the aims of the individual and those of the community have become almost one.\\nTagore did not neglect the lesser aims of life and education. In the colonial system of\\neducation that existed at that time the whole focus of education was on employment, to the\\ncomplete neglect of the higher aims of life. His intention was to correct this wrong emphasis,\\nwithout ignoring science, technology and agricultural sciences, as well as training in village crafts.\\nWithout these, it was not possible to revive the derelict life of rural India. Both categories of aims\\nshould thus be considered the objective of education.\\nIt was necessary, Tagore felt, to make the younger generation aware of their national\\ncultural heritage and to grasp its significance for them. At the same time, education should bring\\nchildren face to face with the cultures of other countries and persuade them to learn from them.\\nTagore put great emphasis on the use of a national languag e as the vehicle of education at\\nall stages of education. He wanted Indian universities to integrate themselves with society and make\\nan effort to educate people living in the countryside. He did not want education to remain confined\\nto the cities and to particular classes of society.\\nHe was very much concerned with women’s education. His educational institutions have\\nalmost always been co-educational and the number of female students is conspicuously large at\\nSantiniketan. He wanted women and men to be offered similar theoretical courses with separate\\npractical courses for women, since their roles in life differed from those of men.\\nTagore considered teachers to be very important in any scheme of education. He wanted\\nteachers to help young children to grow on their own as a gardener helps the young plants to grow.\\nHe wanted to use education as an instrument of change to make Indian young men and women\\nmore rational and less subject to meaningless social and individual rituals.\\nTagore wanted his students t o acquire a scientific temper; in other words, he wanted\\nteachers to stimulate constructive doubt, the love of mental adventure, the courage and longing to\\nconquer the world by enterprise and boldness in thought and in action. These were the virtues\\ncultivation of which had made the West forge ahead.\\nTagore was against any form of corporal punishment to impose discipline. He wanted'),\n",

He wanted them to\\nbecome universal men and women like himself and to overcome feelings of narrow nationalism in\\norder that the world could live and grow in peace and fellowship.\\nThe poet passed away in 1941. The two institutions specific to Tagore’s educational ideas\\nand experiments still survive in the form of Patha Bhawan (the school section) at Santiniketan and\\nin the form of Sikshasastra and Sri Niketan—of course, they have been modified a good deal over\\nthis long stretch of time. They form the core of the Santiniketan ideal. Visva Bharati survives too; it\\nis now a central university and has changed considerably. The emphasis that Tagore placed on the\\nteaching of the fine arts and crafts, and on music, continues in the form of two separate\\nautonomous institutions under the general supervision of Visva Bharati. These institutions are: the\\nKala Bhawan (the school of fine arts); and the Sangeet Bhawan (the school of music and dance).\\nEmphasis on the teaching of various Indian languages and on the teaching of Asian cultures, and\\nthe presence of an international faculty are not very evident. But there is a Cheena Bhawan (the\\nschool of Chinese language and culture), Hindi Bhawan, a School of Islamic Studies, and a good\\nnumber of students from Far Eastern countries, particularly in the Kala Bhawan and the Sangeet\\nBhawan.\\nBut one can see that Tagore’s memory still d ominates life on the university campus. The\\nfollowing poem from  Gitanjali [Song offerings] brings together the ideals the poet kept before the\\nnation, before mankind, and before his educational institutions.\\nWhere the mind is without fear,\\nand the heart is held high,\\nWhere the world is not broken up into fragments\\nby narrow domestic walls,\\nWhere the words came out from\\nthe depths of truth,\\nWhere tireless striving stretches its arms\\ntowards perfection;\\nWhere the clear stream of reason has not lost its\\nway into the dreary desert sand of dead habits,\\nWhere the mind is led forward by thee into\\neverwidening thought and action -\\nInto that heaven of freedom,\\nMy father, let my country awake.26\\nNotes\\n1.

He was highly influential in introducing Indian culture to the West and vice versa, and he is generally regarded as the outstanding creative artist of early 20th-century India. In 1913 he became the first non-European to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature.  Early life and education The son of the religious reformer Debendranath Tagore, he early began to write verses, and, after incomplete studies in England in the late 1870s, he returned to India. There he published several books of poetry in the 1880s and completed Manasi (1890), a collection that marks the maturing of his genius. It contains some of his best-known poems, including many in verse forms new to Bengali, as well as some social and political satire that was critical of his fellow Bengalis.   Life in East Bengal and literary maturity Rabindranath TagoreIndian poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore.(more)In 1891 Tagore went to East Bengal (now in Bangladesh) to manage his family’s estates at Shilaidah and Shazadpur for 10 years. There he often stayed in a houseboat on the Padma River (the main channel of the Ganges River), in close contact with village folk, and his sympathy for them became the keynote of much of his later writing. Most of his finest short stories, which examine “humble lives and their small miseries,” date from the 1890s and have a poignancy, laced with gentle irony, that is unique to him (though admirably captured by the director Satyajit Ray in later film adaptations). Tagore came to love the Bengali countryside, most of all the Padma River, an often-repeated image in his verse. During these years he published several poetry collections, notably Sonar Tari (1894; The Golden Boat), and plays, notably Chitrangada (1892; Chitra). Tagore’s poems are virtually untranslatable, as are his more than 2,000 songs, which achieved considerable popularity among all classes of Bengali society.\\n\\n\\nBritannica Quiz\\nFamous Poets and Poetic Form\\n\\n   Shantiniketan and educational vision 1 of 2Rabindranath Tagore at ShantiniketanRabindranath Tagore (seated, to left of man at blackboard) at an open-air classroom, Shantiniketan, West Bengal.(more)2 of 2Rabindranath Tagore at ShantiniketanRabindranath Tagore in his study at Shantiniketan, West Bengal.(more)Excerpt from Rabindranath Tagore's GitanjaliVerse XXXIX of Rabindranath Tagore's Gitanjali (1910), as recited by Mohammed Sirajullah; audio in Bengali.(more)In 1901 Tagore founded an experimental school in rural West Bengal at Shantiniketan (“Abode of Peace”), where he sought to blend the best in the Indian and Western traditions. He settled permanently at the school, which became Visva-Bharati University in 1921. Years of sadness arising from the deaths of his wife and two children between 1902 and 1907 are reflected in his later poetry, which was introduced to the West in Gitanjali (Song Offerings) (1912). This book, containing Tagore’s English prose translations of religious poems from several of his Bengali verse collections, including Gitanjali (1910), was hailed by W.B. Yeats and André Gide and won him the Nobel Prize in 1913. Tagore was awarded a knighthood in 1915, but he repudiated it in 1919 as a protest against the Amritsar (Jallianwalla Bagh) Massacre. Rabindranath Tagore’s prose translation of Verse XXXIX from Gitanjali (Song Offerings) (1912)\\n  When the heart is hard and parched up, come upon me with a shower of mercy. When grace is lost from life, come with a burst of song. When tumultuous work raises its din on all sides shutting me out from beyond, come to me, my lord of silence, with thy peace and rest. When my beggarly heart sits crouched, shut up in a corner, break open the door, my king, and come with the ceremony of a king.  When desire blinds the mind with delusion and dust, O thou holy one, thou wakeful, come with thy light and thy thunder.  Did you know?Rabindranath Tagore is the only poet credited with authoring the national anthems of two countries.India’s national anthem, “Jana Gana Mana”, is derived from his 1911 Bengali poem “Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata”. It was formally adopted by the Constituent Assembly on January 24, 1950.Bangladesh’s national anthem, “Amar Sonar Bangla” (“My Golden Bengal”), was written in 1905 during the partition of Bengal. It was officially adopted in 1972 after independence under Article 4.1 of the country’s constitution.   Later works and artistic pursuits From 1912 Tagore spent long periods out of India, lecturing and reading from his work in Europe, the Americas, and East Asia and becoming an eloquent spokesperson for the cause of Indian independence. Tagore’s novels in Bengali are less well known than his poems and short stories; they include Gora (1910) and Ghare-Baire (1916), translated into English as Gora and The Home and the World, respectively. In the late 1920s, when he was in his 60s, Tagore took up painting and produced works that won him a place among India’s foremost contemporary artists.  W.
